### Some Personal Facts

Welcome to my economics blog. It exists to develop "a habit of expression",
maintain familiarity with math and programming, and to /appear/
productive at work during slow days. 

I'm a Kansan, a student of economics, and I now work in antitrust consulting in Washington, D.C. 

I'm now curious about [monopsony power in labor markets](https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/anticompetitive-mergers/) and [why people move to cities](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2018/eb_18-10). 

At elite institutions, it is [an easy mistake](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/opinion/kavanaugh-ivy-league-meritocracy.html) to evaluate your privilege relative to your (deeply non-representative) peers.
