### Some Personal Facts

I'm a native of Wichita, Kansas; a graduate of Williams College; a student of economics; and, at least until 2021, a research associate with NERA Economic Consulting in Washington, D.C.

I work in antitrust litigation. I'm curious about [monopsony power in labor markets](https://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/anticompetitive-mergers/) and why people move to cities. 

At elite institutions, it is [an easy mistake](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/opinion/kavanaugh-ivy-league-meritocracy.html) to evaluate your privilege relative to your (deeply non-representative) peers.
