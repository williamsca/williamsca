David Brooks makes a number of interesting observations about
families in his recent [article for The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/).

Before the nuclear family, many
children grew up in extended families, expansive households consisting
of married couples
with "seven or eight children" and "stray aunts, uncles, and cousins,
as well as unrelated servants, apprentices, and farmhands." This type
of household was most common before 1900, and supplied labor to
family-run businesses, like farms or dry-good stores.

Brooks notes that living with a large families may limit mobility. It's not so easy to uproot children and grandparents when a
better job opens up in the next state. Strangely, the largest families are
just as likely to move as 2-person ones:

People choose a family arrangement that will benefit them.
