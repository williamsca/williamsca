*Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they
have will be taken from them.* (Mark 4:25)

Imagine, for a moment, that virtue might be measured as easily as
income or height. Nevermind the impossibility of distilling a
multidimensional concept into a single number. Is that virtue
equitably distributed across the U.S.? Or is it concentrated in the
lives of a few monks and social workers, while the rest of us possess
only bits of kindness and drabs of courage?

One might proxy for virtue by looking at a person's charitable
work. Of course, this measure is deeply flawed: the conspicuous
altruism of charity balls and private foundations is not always
virtuous, a person may be generous with her time rather than her
money, and generosity is only one of the virtues. Indeed, the only
point in its favor is that I can think of no better.

We can, following Jesus' lead, scale a person's charitable giving by
the size of her income[^1].

[^1]: "Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "Truly I tell you,
    this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the
    others. They gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put
    in everything - all she had to live on." (Mark 12:43-44)
