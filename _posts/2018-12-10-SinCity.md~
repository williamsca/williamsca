Are city-folk or rural-folk more virtuous? The evidence is mixed, but several compelling theories point towards the latter.

| Pro-urban | Pro-rural |
|-----------|-----------|
|Most urbanites voted for Hillary, while those outside cities [pulled for Trump](https://www.npr.org/2016/11/14/501737150/rural-voters-played-a-big-part-in-helping-trump-defeat-clinton). To the extent that you find the president to be an Agent of Evil, cities look more virtuous. | Income inequality is [lower for rural housholds](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/11/income-poverty-rural-america.html) than urban households. If you believe that a more equal community is a more virtuous one, then rural areas should win. |
|People in cities drive less and consequently emit less carbon than those in rural areas. If you are concerned about climate change, [city-dwellers are doing better](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/mar/23/city-dwellers-smaller-carbon-footprints). | [Religious fervor](https://news.gallup.com/poll/7960/age-religiosity-rural-america.aspx) and [charitable giving](https://philanthropy.iupui.edu/files/research/2010spring_ruralurbanphilanthropy.pdf) (and a % of income) are greater outside cities, both markers of virtue. |
