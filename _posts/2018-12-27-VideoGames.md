## Pragmatic Learning

Rare is the child who never asks, "Why must I learn this?" Rousseau encourages this skepticism [^1]. Rather than inventing an answer, he recommends contriving a situation where the knowledge in question is desperately needed. The unwilling geographer is lost in the woods, or the hesitant mathematician underestimates how much pizza to get for his birthday party, and both become model students.

The connection between knowledge and profit is sometimes obvious. But some topics do not admit a simple illustration. When the reward lies in the knowledge itself, as it does sometimes with music or ethics, it is harder to devise a convincing lesson.

Such topics are hallmarks of children's literature. In E. B. White's *The Trumpet of the Swan*, the mute swan Louis finds that music opens all kinds of doors. Kate DiCamillo's *The Tale of Despereaux* describes how a mouse can redeem a despised rat. And survival stories, like *My Side of the Mountain*, *Hatchet*, and Rousseau's favorite *Robinson Crusoe* [^2], need no explanation.

These learning situations could be real or literary. However, they might also be provided by a video game. Like books, video games are cheap to distribute, easy to tailor, and able to motivate a lesson. Unlike books, games can teach the lesson, too.

## My Man Fortnite

The phenomenal success of Fortnite caused a [predictable backlash](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200). The narrative and lessons of Fortnite, however, are essentially the same as those in *Robinson Crusoe*: you arrive on an island, scavenge resources, find your allies, and fight off the other players (Crusoe's cannibals). The game rewards industry and self-reliance. To what extent is better to teach these virtues with *Robinson Crusoe*, a book with now-disturbing colonialist themes, than with Fortnite?

The rejoinder, of course, is that Fortnite tends to exclude all other activities. No child ever became addicted to reading survival stories or playing outside, after all.

## What Remains

I learned a startling lesson about the perils of imaginary worlds from a video game, of all places. In a remarkable sequence from the new title *What Remains of Edith Finch*, a character who works a monotonous job at a cannery invents a fantasy world where he rules as king.

[^1]: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, *Emile, or On Education*.
[^2]: "This is the first book Emile will read; for a long time it will form his whole library, and it will always retain an honoured place... What is this wonderful book? Is it Aristotle? Pliny? Buffon? No; it is *Robinson Crusoe*."
