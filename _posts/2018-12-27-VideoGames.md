Rare is the child who never asks, "Why must I learn this?" Rousseau encourages this skepticism. Rather than inventing an answer, he recommends that the teacher contrive a situation where the knowledge in question is desperately needed ([^1]). The unwilling geographer is lost in the woods, or the hesitant mathematician underestimates how much pizza to get for his birthday party, and both become model students.

The connection between knowledge and profit is sometimes obvious. But some topics do not admit a simple illustration. When the reward lies in the knowledge itself, as it does sometimes with music or ethics, it is harder to devise a convincing lesson.

Such topics are hallmarks of children's literature. In E. B. White's *The Trumpet of the Swan*, the mute swan Louis finds that music opens all kinds of doors. Kate DiCamillo's *The Tale of Despereaux* describes how a mouse can redeem a despised rat. And survival stories, like *My Side of the Mountain*, *Hatchet*, and Rousseau's favorite *Robinson Crusoe* ([^2]), need no explanation.

These learning situations can be real or literary. However, they might also come from a video game. Like story books, video games are cheap to distribute, easy to tailor, and can motivate a lesson. Unlike stories, games can teach the lesson, too.

## My Man Fortnite

The phenomenal success of Fortnite caused a [predictable backlash](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200) from parents. It's a familiar story: a new game takes over boys lives, causing them to do poorly in school and miss out on the particular childhood joy of playing outside. 

It occurs to me that adults spend almost no time at all playing outside, so it is somewhat surprising that they recommend it so strongly to their children.

It's interesting that Fornite motivates the same lessons as *Robinson Crusoe*. The similarities are striking: you arrive on an island, scavenge resources, build a base, find your allies, and fight off other players (or in Crusoe's case, cannibals). The game rewards industry and self-reliance. To what extent is it better to teach these skills with *Crusoe* than with Fortnite?

The rejoinder, of course, is that Fortnite tends to crowd out other activities. No child got hooked on reading survival stories or playing outside, after all. Or maybe they did and you just didn't notice, since getting really and truly excited about things -- sports, books, TV, animals, or even video games -- is part of what makes childhood so special.

## Bowling Together

Parents are the architect of a particular kind of game for their children. They craft rules, provide incentives, and manipulate the environment, hoping to accelerate learning. Frequently, these games are simulacra of the very same games that parents play in their own lives. They give an allowance, assign chores, and schedule activities, mirroring their own paychecks, jobs, and hobbies.

It is natural to want people to play the same games that you play. If you play the same game, you can play *together*: sharing knowledge, training skills, and appreciating mastery. The last point is, I think, particularly important. Only someone skilled at chess can appreciate the artistry of a grandmaster. Only someone who has played outside can appreciate the industry and imagination it takes to have fun when you haven't got much else.

In this light, it's easy to see why parents might be unhappy with Fortnite: it leaves them with fewer games to play with their children.

## What Remains

I would be remiss if I said nothing about how games can go wrong. Fortunately, I recently played a game that showed exactly that.

There is a remarkable episode in the new title [What Remains of Edith Finch](http://www.giantsparrow.com/games/finch/), a short game about a long-cursed family. In it, one unhappy scion works a monotonous job at a cannery, spending his days inventing an imaginary world where he rules as king. His fantasy grows to occupy his entire attention, relegating his day job to a corner of the screen.

The sequence is disturbing because the character has invented for himself a completely /single-player/ game. His fantasy world does not admit guests, and he ultimately never leaves it. So long as games are played (or at least discussed) together, they remain tethered to the world rather than floating free into the ether.

You can think about games as tools for learning, harmless pastimes, or dangerously anti-social, and you would be right. Fortnite is *Robinson Crusoe*, playing outside, and slamming the door to your room, all rolled into one. At the end of the day, though, it's also something to share.
