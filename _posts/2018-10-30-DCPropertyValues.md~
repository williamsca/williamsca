title: Data on Washington, DC Property Values
---

I put together a dataset of housing prices in DC. The data include geographic information (address, neighborhood, and sub-neighborhood), [use code](https://otr.cfo.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/otr/publication/attachments/Use%20codes.pdf), sale price, recordation date, and the assessed value.

The data come from scraping the DC Office of Tax and Revenue website ([](https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Search.jsp?search_type=Assessment)). The data span from 2015 through 2017, though earlier years are available.
