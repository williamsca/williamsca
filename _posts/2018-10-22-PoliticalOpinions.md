title: What is the Use of a Political Opinion?
categories: Opinion
---

It is well known that the liklihood your vote will affect the outcome of the presidential election is [vanishingly small](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/vote.pdf). Suppose, for the sake of argument, that it is effectively 0.

In the past, I rationalized voting based on the following statements:
1. My vote will increase the odds that candidate A is elected
2. If candidate A is elected, then policy X is more likely to be implemented
3. I believe that policy X will provide a social benefit
4. Therefore, I should vote for candidate A

If (1) is not true, my argument is unsound, and I need a new reason to vote.

Here is one nice option: voting is a way to signal to your community that (a) you believe the electoral system is fair(ish), and are therefore (b) committed to the outcome, for good or ill, because (c) at the end of the day, we are all in this together. 

This argument says nothing about 'candidates' or 'policies'. Indeed, you could send signals (a), (b), and (c) by filling out a blank ballot. Basically, there is a passably good reason to vote, even if you know nothing at all about universal Medicare, immigration, or trade policy.

I want to say that forming political opinions is unnecessary. The *only* point of being for or against the $15 minimum wage, say, is that your belief may cause the government to enact your chosen policy because of your vote. But the link between your belief and national policy is tenuous at best, so the intellectual work it requires to formulate that belief is not going to have a positive return.

There are a few caveats here. First, you may aspire to wield the influence of a public intellectual. In this case, it is of course valuable to think through your political opinions so that you can communicate them well and potentially move the needle on an issue. Second, you may have significant influence on local elections, whose issues should accordingly be given greater value. 

Finally, discussing politics is one of the great joys in life. It's important to keep in mind, though, that even a brilliant, passionate exposition of your view that converts the room to your side is not going to materially affect reality. Give politics the importance it deserves, and no more. A friend or family member is worth five hundred swing-voters.
