Notice that the share of inscriptions uncovered near Rome falls from almost 40% to below 10% between 100 BC and 200 AD. 

The concentration of inscriptions between 200 and 250 miles from Rome come primarily from the province of [Dalmatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia_(Roman_province)), a Balkan region particularly well-documented in the EDH dataset.

## What Deserves to be Read

*True glory consists in doing what deserves to be written; in writing what deserves to be read.*

	\- Pliny the Elder

may be crafted carefully -- a friend of mine plans her Instagram captions up to six months in advance -- or thoughtlessly.
