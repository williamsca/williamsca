Shortly after arriving in DC, I asked a retired bookseller to
recommend books about the city, in any genre. He could only think of
two. I've since added a number of my own finds to this list, which I
present in the hopes that other residents of our capital will find it
useful in developing an appreciation for the hitory and beauty of this place.
