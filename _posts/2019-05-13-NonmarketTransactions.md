title: Most Transactions are Non-Market Transactions

Aside from the thirty minutes each year that the two of you negotiate your salary, no market transactions occur between you and your boss. Your relationship is primarily hierarchical (and, one hopes, halfway collegial). 

Even between coworkers, market transactions are generally beyond the pale of professional behavior. Why does no one pay a colleague to do a task that they were assigned? 

Coworkers do trade shifts. Even then, however, the exchange is typically in kind.  In high school, I worked at a local waterpark. Lifeguards, saddled with a shift in the middle of their family's summer vacation, would advertise the shift on a bulletin board in the guard shack. They would offer terms: a willingness to take another guard's shift, baked goods, even once a massage.

And of course couples and families rarely make explicit economic transactions among themselves (paying children to mow the lawn aside).

What are the useful features of non-market transactions?
