title: Build More by Compensating Current Residents

Current residents bear the costs of new development. Those costs take many forms -- crowded schools, congested freeways, crime, ugly high-rises, spillover parking on residential streets -- but they all decrease property values. Accordingly, homeowners and landlords are often vocal opponents of new development, and seek to impose burdensome or prohibative costs on developers through zoning regulations.

In an ideal world, anyone wanting to move to a city could compensate the current residents for the congestion costs that they would impose. In practice, perhaps the most straightforward method would be for developers to provide cash payments to all residents living within a certain radius of any new construction, but an indirect payment funneled through the local government into various public goods, such as schools, parks, or libraries, could also work.

The Cicero Institute makes the case for this scheme in their proposal ["Align incentives for neighborhoods to build"](https://www.housingforcalifornia.org/proposals/incentives). They want to channel existing "impact fees", which currently flow to the city government, to the local neighborhood instead:

> If each of San Francisco's 36 neighborhoods had a political organization, similar to
> the currently weak "Community Boards" in New York, or the Advisory Neighborhood 
> Commissions in Washington D.C., or merely a citizens' body under the control of the
> local district supervisor, which could help distribute those fees, the gains to a
> neighborhood from growth could be vast.

It is worth nothing that localizing the benefits of new construction is not a novel idea. Donald Shoup proposes a similar plan in his monumental *The High Cost of Free Parking*. TODO

The Cicero Institute proposal notes that many previous attempts to encourage new residential development have failed or backfired. TODO.

Given this history of failure, the Cicero Institute's proposal deserves careful scrutiny.

One issue with their plan is that it risks adding another layer of regulation to an already convoluted process.

Another issue is that all current residents are not identically harmed by new construction. A new apartment building across the street is much more costly than one on the opposite side of the neighborhood. The Institute's plan acknowledges this issue, allocating "25% of the funds to neighbors and landholders within a quarter mile of the project, who tend to be the most concerned about development." While this goes some way to
