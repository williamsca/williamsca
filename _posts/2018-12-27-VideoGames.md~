Rare is the child who never asks, "Why must I learn this?" Rousseau encourages this skepticism. Rather than inventing an answer, he recommends contriving a situation where the knowledge in question is desperately needed. The unwilling geographer is lost in the woods, or the hesitant mathematician underestimates how much pizza to get for his birthday party, and both become model students.

The connection between knowledge and profit is sometimes obvious. But with other topics -- poetry and literature come to mind -- the gain cannot be illustrated so simply. The motivation to study these subjects must come from either fear of the instructor or faith that they will somehow, someday be useful.

Bear with me; I'll get to video games eventually.

How might poetry be useful?
