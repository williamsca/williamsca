title: Fact-Checking Donald Trump

When Donald Trump claims his inauguration crowd was the largest ever, he is not communicating a fact about a past state of the world. He is using an obvious lie to communicate something more interesting to his base. I enumerate a number of possible (non-exclusive) candidates.

* In the same way that a Scientologist can acquire credibility within his religion by (disconnecting)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disconnection] from a friend or family member, President Trump increases his reputation among Republicans by severing ties with the media.

* In the same way that a Christian can demonstrate his commitment to the faith by professing belief in the apparently impossible Resurrection of Jesus Christ, President Trump demonstrates his commitment to his base by claiming the impossible about his inauguration. By sacrificing his status among the left, he increases it among the right.

* By telling an obvious lie, President Trump demonstrates his willingness to question recieved wisdom and explore alternate explanations. If recieved wisdom puts you at a disadvantage economically or socially -- the lot of a low-skill worker is unlikely to be improved by more immigration, for instance, and the welfare of a prudent gun-owner will inevitably be decreased by more stringent gun control -- this is an appealing quality.

While fact-checking President Trump may increase the reputational cost he pays for lying among the left, it may actually increase his gains among the right. The act of fact-checking increases the number of people aware of the lie. It makes the fact that Pres. Trump was willing to be exposed in this way all the more impressive.

Some have proposed a kind of (reputational score) for media outlets to allow readers to gauge their trustworthiness. This may be useful for people who are committed to capital-T Truth, but does not solve the problem that, sometimes, a lie can communicate what the truth cannot.
