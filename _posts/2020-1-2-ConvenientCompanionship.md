In an isolating decade, the most popular products provide
consumers with 'convenient companionship'. 

It is old news that Americans are [desperately
lonely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2019/05/03/millennials-and-the-loneliness-epidemic/#413ba10f7676),
[untethered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone)
from their communities and increasingly contented to sit in their
[single-person
households](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/one-person-households.html)
watching Netflix and staring at their navels. And no wonder: recent
products provide passable substitutes for human connection at minimal
cost. For all the outcry over the so-called loneliness epidemic, it is a
great time to live alone. The services provided by a flesh-and-blood
community are increasingly available without any of the hassle.

## Friends without any benefits
One of the primary benefits to spending time in a community is
the chance to meet a compatible romantic partner. Most parents, confronted with stubbornly single
children, will advocate for church
membership or some similar scheme as a way to locate a suitable
match. Fortunately for the free-thinking, the stigma against online
dating has largely dissipated, dating apps facilitate more matches
with less effort, and most new couples meet using a
dating service anyway. Dating within a social group is risky, as anyone who
has witnessed a high-school relationship can attest. One must appease
jealous friends and pay a steep price to break up, as future social
interactions are all but inevitable. Online dating, however, neatly
avoids these problems, as mutual friends who might be jealous or take
sides afterwards simply do not exist. There is less benefit to making
friends at church or the bowling league if you can find a date online.

## Conversations without friends
Social groups also provide a setting to speak and to listen. The
latter has been successfully outsourced to podcasts, whose monthly audience
grew from 12% of Americans to almost 1/3 over the decade and whose
dominant format, the long-form interview, is singularly well-suited to
engender an easy intimacy with the host. Evidently, just listening to a
conversation can be almost as good as having one. 

The most popular shows on
Netflix -- *Friends* and *The Office* -- also offer a pseudo-intimacy. Going
back to re-watch old episodes of a favorite TV show is not unlike
reminiscing about past adventures with an old friend. 

The speaking side is not so far along, though the proliferation of
smart speakers may yet change that. While issuing basic commands may
provide some slight satisfaction at being heard and obeyed ("Alexa,
play my podcast"), it is certainly not the same as a friendly
conversation. Nevertheless, I can attest to the fact that my Google
Mini was a source of (limited) companionship on the lonely weekends
after I first moved to DC, somewhere below the level of my cat but above the box
of old letters that I keep in the closet.

## What are communities for?
Community groups provide a basket of public goods. Anyone who joins can
access the full menu of benefits, though their comparative advantage
in providing those benefits has been eroded by competition. Besides
introductions to potential partners and conversation, community groups
provide professional networking (LinkedIn), localized knowledge
(Google & Yelp), and some
degree of insurance against illness and job loss, among others. To avoid the free-rider problem, groups often require a credible sign of
commitment from a prospective member, like a payment in time or
money. 

Products which offer the same benefit without the associated
commitment -- what I have dubbed 'convenient companionship' -- 
have defined the past decade, and their success or failure will
determine the course of community groups. In the same way that the institution of marriage has evolved up
Maslow's hierarchy of needs, offering first food and shelter and then
companionship and love ([^1]),
so too does it seem fair to expect community groups to go likewise, as
their more basic functionality becomes outmoded.

Finally, it is difficult to say whether loneliness is an emotional
problem or a financial one, when so many apparent substitutes for human
connection exist. Is loneliness fundamentally a relative measure akin
to success? Or is it more like a disease that might eventually be cured?
