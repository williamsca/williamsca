title: Spatial Patterns of Firms with Monopsony Power (Part 1)

The economist Harold Hotelling pointed out that two store owners will naturally locate their stores [right next to each other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law) so that they will appeal to the largest possible number of buyers. 

If the store owners are competing to hire workers, however, they may want to keep some distance between themselves. In this post, I develop and simulate a simple model with one firm hiring workers who are uniformly distributed across a unit square. Later posts will extend the model to include more firms, who will avoid close proxmimity, and so I will test various mechanisms that incentivize the firms to clump together.

All the math in this first section can safely be ignored. The story is quite simple and can be comprehended from the pictures and text.

## Laying the Groudwork

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import minimize
```

A lone entrepreneur (call her Ruby) arrives in a vast wilderness, uniformly populated by farming homesteads. As the bearer of advanced industrial technology, Ruby promptly sets up a factory and hires some locals. She locates her factory directly in the center of the region.


```python
# Set the initial location for Ruby's factory
def plotFirms(points, labels):
    for point, label in zip(points, labels):
        plt.plot(point, visible=False)
        plt.annotate(label, xy=point)
        
    plt.axis([0, 1, 0, 1])
    
plotFirms([(0.5, 0.5)], ["R"])
```

Ruby is eager to maximize her profits. She can sell her widgets back East for 1 gold each, and each worker she hires can produce 1 widget. Thus, her profit is given by $\prod = N_w * (1 - w)$, where $N_w$ is the number of workers she can hire at wage $w$. 


```python
# Calculate Ruby's (negative) profit
def profit(w, N_w):
    return -(N_w * (1 - w))  
```

The farmers in the region can always obtain a wage of zero by working in the field. They incur travel costs $\beta$ that are linear in the distance to Ruby's factory, so they will choose to work whenever $w - \beta \sqrt{(x_n - 0.5)^2 + (y_n - 0.5)^2} \geq 0$.

The factory's "draw area" is the circle $\dfrac{w^2}{\beta^2} = (x - 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2$ which has area $A = \pi * \dfrac{w^2}{\beta^2}$. Note that $A$ is also the fraction of the unit square contained by $A$.

If $N$ is the total number of workers in the region, then Ruby will hire $N_w = N * A = N * \pi * \dfrac{w^2}{\beta^2}$ workers. Her maximization problem is $\max_w\{N * \pi * \dfrac{w^2}{\beta^2} * (1 - w)\}$. Some calculus gives that Ruby will maximize profit at $w = \frac{2}{3}$.


```python
# Initiate the unit square for plotting and simulating.
step = 0.003
x = np.arange(0, 1, step)
y = np.arange(0, 1, step)
xx, yy = np.meshgrid(x, y, sparse = True)
```


```python
# Draw factory's "draw area"
beta = 2
def shareWorkers(pos, w, plot=0):
    x1, y1 = pos[0]
    d = np.sqrt((xx - x1)**2 + (yy - y1)**2)
    
    if plot:
        plotFirms(pos, ["R"])
        plt.contour(x, y, (w - beta * d), [0])
        
    return np.pi * w**2 / beta**2

A = shareWorkers([(0.5, 0.5)], .6667, plot=1)
print(A)
```

```python
# Calculate Ruby's profit
N = 100
N_w = N * A
profit(.6667, N_w)

(Ignore the minus sign. Scipy.optimize provides an algorithm to minimize a function, so we will later maximize profit by minimizing negative profit.) While we can solve explicitly for the share of workers as a function of the wage when there is a single firm, the problem becomes much more complex with two or more competitors. Each farmer will have to compare two wages and his reservation wage of \$0 before making a decision. Accordingly, we can simulate the share as below, realizing that almost certainly there is a more efficient way to do so.


```python
# Numerically solve for the fraction of workers that a firm employs for a given wage.
def shareWorkers(positions, wages, plot = 0):
    for pos, wage in zip(positions, wages):
    x1, y1 = pos
    x2, y2 = pos_other
    
    # calculate the distance each worker must travel to both firms
    d = np.sqrt((xx - x1)**2 + (yy - y1)**2)
    d_other = np.sqrt((xx - x2)**2 + (yy - y2)**2)
    d_diff = d - d_other
    
    # plot the dividing line between the firms
    if plot:
        plotFirms()
        plt.contour(x, y, (w - d - (w_other - d_other)), [0])
        plt.draw()
    
    # workers choose the firm that maximizes W - c, where c is a function of distance
    # if her net wage is negative, the worker stays at home
    lambd = np.multiply(w / w_other - 1 > d_diff, w - d >= 0)
    
    # return the fraction of workers who choose this firm
    return np.sum(lambd) / (1 / step**2)
```


```python
# Numerically solve for the fraction of workers that a firm employs for a given wage.
def shareN(pos, pos_other, w, w_other, plot = 0):
    x1, y1 = pos
    x2, y2 = pos_other
    
    # calculate the distance each worker must travel to both firms
    d = np.sqrt((xx - x1)**2 + (yy - y1)**2)
    d_other = np.sqrt((xx - x2)**2 + (yy - y2)**2)
    d_diff = d - d_other
    
    # plot the dividing line between the firms
    if plot:
        plotFirms()
        plt.contour(x, y, (w - d - (w_other - d_other)), [0])
        plt.draw()
    
    # workers choose the firm that maximizes W - c, where c is a function of distance
    # if her net wage is negative, the worker stays at home
    lambd = np.multiply(w / w_other - 1 > d_diff, w - d >= 0)
    
    # return the fraction of workers who choose this firm
    return np.sum(lambd) / (1 / step**2)
```
