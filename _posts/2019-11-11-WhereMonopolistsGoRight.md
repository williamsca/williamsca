It is lately fashionable to attribute the ills of America's economy to [unchecked](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/opinion/big-business-consumer-prices.html) market power. But the monopolist, like a spider, possesses regrettably useful qualities, and she deserves some small sympathy before we crush her underfoot.

Airlines are a familiar bogeyman. The U.S. market is dominated by four firms, so it is unsurprising that the cost of flying here [far exceeds](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/04/22/a-lack-of-competition-explains-the-flaws-in-american-aviation) that in Europe, where budget airlines compete fiercely. But lower airfares are no unalloyed good. Just ask Greta Thunberg, who [sailed across the Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_of_Greta_Thunberg) to avoid the enormous carbon cost of flying. By restricting the quantity of flights to drive up their price, airline oligopolists are doing their part to combat climate change.

In a perfect world, we might have both a competitive airline industry *and* a carbon tax. Given the political impossibility of the latter, it is almost certainly worth overlooking apparent market power in carbon-intensive industries.

What about non-polluting industries? You may be worried that Facebook, Google, and [Amazon](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox) have rigged the digital economy and stolen your data. But dominant tech firms are well-suited to fund new research and products. They face less risk that their innovations will be stolen by competing firms. They can use monopoly profits and internal knowledge to fund projects that outside investors would deem too risky. And they benefit more from process innovations by virtue of their greater scale and scope.

There are few evils which may be remedied without causing harm elsewhere. We are rightly cautious about disturbing an ecosystem by warming the planet or introducing an invasive species, yet many regard the number of firms in a market as a rarefied variable subject to the control of a policy-maker. When applying antitrust policy, a note of humility is warranted.
