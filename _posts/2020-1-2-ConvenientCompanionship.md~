In an isolating decade, the most popular products provide
consumers with 'convenient companionship'. 

It is old news that Americans are [desperately
lonely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2019/05/03/millennials-and-the-loneliness-epidemic/#413ba10f7676),
[untethered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_Alone)
to their communities and increasingly contented to sit in their
[single-person
households](https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2019/comm/one-person-households.html)
watching Netflix and staring at their navels. And no wonder: recent
products provide passable substitutes for human connection at minimal
cost. For all the outcry over the so-called lonliness epidemic, it is a
great time to live alone. The services provided by a flesh-and-blood
community are increasingly available without any of the hassle.

## Friendships without the benefits
I suspect that many parents, confronted with stubbornly single
children, advocate for church
membership or some similar scheme as a way to locate a suitable
match. Fortunately for the free-thinking, the stigma against online
dating has largely dissapeared, dating apps facilitate more matches
with less effort, and most new couples meet using a
dating service anyway. Dating within a social group is risky, as anyone who
has witnessed a high-school relationship can attest. One must appease
jealous friends and pay a steep price to break up, as future social
interactions are all but inevitable. Online dating, however, neatly
avoids these problems, as mutual friends simply do not exist. 

Community groups are a kind of public good. Anyone who joins can
access the full menu of benefits: professional networking,
introductions to potential partners, localized knowledge, and some
degree of insurance against illness and job loss, among many
others. To avoid the free-rider problem, groups often require a credible sign of
commitment from a prospective member, typically a payment in time or money.
