title: What is the Use of a Political Opinion?
---

It is well known that the liklihood your vote will affect the outcome of the presidential election is [vanishingly small](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/vote.pdf). Given this fact, you may imagine that a strict utilitarian would conclude that the time spent researching candidates, travelling to the polling place, and casting a ballot might have been more profitably spent volunteering.

I still vote. I like to think it is a matter of civic duty, though I'm not sure exactly what that means. A charitable view is that voting is a way to signal to your community that you (1) believe the electoral system is fair(ish), and (2) are committed to the outcome, for good or ill.

None of this, however, says anything about the content of your vote. I could equally well send (1) and (2) as signals by filling out a blank ballot.
