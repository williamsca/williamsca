QUOTE: So, for example, if you were selling a home for $400,000, your transfer tax would cost you $5,800. Assuming you¡¯d agreed to split these taxes, your buyer would pay the same amount in recordation tax. If, on the other hand, you agree to reduce your sales price to $399,000, your transfer tax is $4,389, and your buyer would pay $4,389 in recordation taxes.
