A first look at property transactions in DC suggests that something unusual is happening at $400,000.

Some research turns up [the answer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/2013/02/07/9adf285e-7073-11e2-a050-b83a7b35c4b5_story.html?_=ddid-7-1541627520&utm_term=.682a5c1a7d9f). The District collects a 2.2% tax on transactions below $400,000, and a 2.9% tax on those above.

 > So, for example, if you were selling a home for $400,000, your transfer tax would cost you $5,800.
 > Assuming you¡¯d agreed to split these taxes, your buyer would pay the same amount in recordation tax.
 > If, on the other hand, you agree to reduce your sales price to $399,000, your transfer tax is $4,389,
 > and your buyer would pay $4,389 in recordation taxes.
