David Brooks makes a number of interesting observations about
families in his recent [article for The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/).

Before the nuclear family, many
children grew up in extended families, expansive households consisting
of married couples
with "seven or eight children" and "stray aunts, uncles, and cousins,
as well as unrelated servants, apprentices, and farmhands." This type
of household was most common before 1900, and supplied labor to
family-run businesses, like farms or dry-good stores.

One drawback of extended families is that they make moving extremely
costly.
