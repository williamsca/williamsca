There's an old joke about a violist who suffers weekly at the hands of
his conductor during rehearsals. The conductor humiliates him by
pointing out his every mistake to the rest of the orchestra, and the
violist starts to think he can never do anything right.

One day, the violist comes home and finds fire engines and police cars parked
around his still-burning house. He asks what happened. A policeman
tells him that his conductor came by to see him, but didn't find him
home, so in a fit of rage the conductor shot his wife and his kids, and set his
house on fire. The violist delightedly cries, "the conductor came to see ME?!"

## A Conductor's Life
The principal conductor, sometimes referred to as a music director,
determines the culture of an ensemble. And jokes about hapless
violists aside, the best conductors can inspire an immense amount of
respect and loyalty in their orchestras.
